# Welcome

This site will be used as my notes for all the Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions I've played in, especially in the Binary Exploitation category. There will be other categories as well depending on how important I think it is for myself to write it down.

Writeups are sorted by:

* Categories based on year
* The event time (from latest to oldest)
* The challenge solve time (from latest to oldest)
