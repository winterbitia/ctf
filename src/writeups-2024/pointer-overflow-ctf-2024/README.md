# ☝️ Pointer Overflow CTF 2024

The extremely long CTF hosted by UWSP. I played with team HCS and got one solve on the Exploit category, which is basically Pwn, which is basically Binary Exploitation. Got the solve in one night but the remote was hilarious because they forgot to put the flag file :sob:
